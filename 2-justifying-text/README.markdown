#Justify Text

##Problem Definition
Suppose you are programming for a really old-school internet newspaper, one that is so old-school that they only have monospace fonts. However, the editor really wants to see the monospace text justified to fit into the column space he has at a particular time. Your job is to write a program that will take as input the width of the column in characters and the entire text to be formatted, and return the same text except justified to fit into the column. 

For example, consider the following input:
***
20
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
***

Then the output of your program should be:
***
The quick  brown fox
jumps over  the lazye
dog.
***

As you can tell from this example, the last line does not have to be justified.
